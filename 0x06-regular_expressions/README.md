# 0x06. Regular Expression

## About

A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”,
is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.

It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings,
or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command).

While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

This project explores some uses of regular expression.
