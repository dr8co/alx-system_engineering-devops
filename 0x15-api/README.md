# 0x15. API

## Introduction

An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface
which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.
It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them,
the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality
in various ways and to varying degrees.

An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed
based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability.
Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming,
allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.
A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.
A programmer then puts the blocks together.

APIs often come in the form of a library that includes specifications for routines,
data structures, object classes, and variables.
In other cases, notably SOAP and REST services, an API is simply a specification
of remote calls exposed to the API consumers.
